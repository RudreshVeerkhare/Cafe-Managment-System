## ðŸ”¥ Your Pitch
In a normal canteen or any cafe in college or corporate campus , there is always rush during peak hours.People need to wait for long time in queue to eat food.This decreases the efficiency of work and wastes time.So, we have developed a system to cater this problem and also provide variety of features along with it.In this system, we give the pre-booking facility to user to book the food beforehand and he/she can easily collect or eat food on time without waiting.User needs to pay beforehand and a token will be sent to user which can verified at cafeteria.At cafeteria side, we have are using AI technology to predict the amount of food required on that particular day so that restaurant can minimize the wastage of food.We are also using recommender system to recommend the related food items.
The reason students will use it because they can avail various offers and benefits.According to business perspective,we are providing convenience to users as well as cafe owners.Therefore a convenience fee will be charged to the user.Restaurant owners will have to pay yearly subscription for our software installation.We may use brand marketting feature and ads as our future scope in which we will list promoted restaurants first in user's feed.We are also thinking to provide business consultancy services to other restaurants by selling the data and food habits of particular area or region.
Last but not the least,we need to give back to society,so we have tie-ups with non profit organisations who provide unused food to hungry and poor people.So, each cafe will submit unused to these organisations to minimize the wastage of food as its very very precious.
